# Knowledge Base Best Practices

## General Guidelines
- Use appropriate embedding models for different types of data
- Maintain consistent vector dimensions across all embeddings
- Implement regular index maintenance and optimization
- Monitor embedding quality and similarity scores

## Data Storage
- Store raw content alongside embeddings for verification
- Maintain metadata for tracking data lineage
- Implement versioning for evolving data
- Use efficient chunking strategies for large documents

## Search and Retrieval
- Use hybrid search (combining semantic and keyword search)
- Implement proper similarity thresholds
- Cache frequently accessed embeddings
- Monitor and optimize query performance

## Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for embedding generation
- Handle API rate limits gracefully
- Log failed embedding attempts
- Maintain data consistency during failures

## Performance Optimization
- Batch embedding requests when possible
- Implement efficient vector similarity search
- Use appropriate indexing strategies
- Monitor and optimize memory usage
