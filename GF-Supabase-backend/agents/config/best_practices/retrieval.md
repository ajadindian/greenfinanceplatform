# Retrieval Best Practices

## General Guidelines
- Maintain context window for conversation history
- Balance between relevance and diversity in results
- Implement proper ranking algorithms
- Monitor retrieval quality metrics

## Context Management
- Implement sliding window for conversation history
- Maintain temporal relevance of retrieved information
- Handle context switching appropriately
- Manage context size to prevent token limits

## Query Processing
- Implement query preprocessing and cleaning
- Use query expansion techniques when appropriate
- Handle edge cases and malformed queries
- Maintain query logs for optimization

## Result Ranking
- Implement proper similarity thresholds
- Use hybrid ranking algorithms
- Consider temporal relevance
- Handle tie-breaking scenarios

## Performance
- Implement caching for frequent queries
- Optimize response times
- Monitor memory usage
- Handle concurrent requests efficiently

## Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation
- Handle timeout scenarios
- Log failed retrievals
- Maintain system stability during failures
